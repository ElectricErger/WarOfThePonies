			Dr W - "I was coming to your castle to investigate just that."
			Dr W - "It appears that we have been taken into some kind of parallel dimension. A time line that diverged from ours at some point."
			Dr W - "As for the where exactly, I'm afraid I have no idea."
			Twilight - "Well sitting around here isn't going to solve anything. We have to find some books."
			Spike - "Or, you know, ponies."
			Twilight - "Semantics."
			Twilight - "Now how do I move again?"

	RD - "First of all, NOBODY calls me Dashie. Do I make myself clear!"
	RD - "As for the Empire, you know which one I'm talking about. I bet you work for Sombra directly."
	Twilight - "WHAT!?"
	Twilight - "Dash, you have to understand. This world was never meant to exist. We took down Sombra along with AppleJack, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy."
	RD - "So you know about our Special Ops unit! I knew it."

	Twilight - "In my world, Sombra originally conquired the Crystal Empire in the North. A cold dark wasteland,"
	Twilight - "Like Canada."
	RD - "What's a Canada?"
	Lyra - "In anthropology, Canada is a Northern country known for it's cold climate and civilians being scared of the dark."
	Twilight - "... yes"
	Twilight - "More importantly, we could only stop Sombra with the power by returning the Crystal Heart."
	RD - "Lyra, get word to the Princesses. We need this Crystal Heart to stop Sombra."

	Twilight - "What he means to say is, what would be our arrangement."
	RD - "You would join my platoon under my command as a consultant. We would fight side-by-side to get this Crystal Heart and defeat Sombra."
	/Turns away
	RD - "But until your facts are checked you will remain our prisoner."
	/Walks away
	Spike - "What was that about?"
	Twilight - "Sorry Spike. Remember, this isn't our Rainbow Dash. We need to reform our friendship before she will trust us."

	RD - "Our diplomatic relations seemed to be going smoothly."
	RD - "We recently started planning to work with the dragons."
